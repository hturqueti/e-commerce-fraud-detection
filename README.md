## Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions in an e-commerce environment using machine learning techniques. The dataset consists of anonymized data points, including credit bureau scores, country of purchase, product information, document submission status, and fraud probability scores generated by an existing model.

The goal is to develop a predictive model that classifies transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent and optimize decision thresholds to maximize the company's financial gains while minimizing fraudulent losses.

## Important Notes

Data Availability: The dataset used in this project is not publicly available due to privacy and security concerns. Only sample data and insights will be shared.

Business Impact: The company earns 10% of the correctly approved payment values, while a fraudulent approval results in a 100% loss of the transaction amount.

## Dataset Description

- **score_1** to **score_10**: Credit bureau scores or anonymized features.

- **country**: Country where the purchase was made.

- **product_name**: The specific product being purchased.

- **product_category**: Category of the product.

- **purchase_date**: The date when the purchase was made.

- **purchase_value**: The monetary value of the transaction.

- **document_delivery_1** to document_delivery_3: Required documents submitted during account creation (0 = Not submitted, 1 = Submitted, empty = Not submitted).

- **fraud_score_model**: Fraud score assigned by the current model (0-100 scale, where higher values indicate higher fraud likelihood).

- **fraud**: Actual fraud status (0 = Not fraud, 1 = Fraud), available after a delay for validation.

## Approach

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Understanding data distribution, missing values, and key insights.

- Investigating correlations between variables.

- Visualizing fraud patterns and transaction behaviors.

### Model Development

- Testing multiple machine learning models to predict fraud occurrence.

- Comparing model performance against the existing fraud score model.

- Evaluating different classification metrics (e.g., AUC-ROC, precision-recall, F1-score).

### Threshold Optimization

- Determining the optimal decision threshold for fraud detection.

- Balancing false positives and false negatives to maximize company profit.
